Quiz test for Manezco
Assessment
Your task is to create a multiple-choice quiz application using React. The requirements have been intentionally kept fairly open so that you can come up with your own approach to the solution.
Requirements:
The quiz is made up of multiple questions, each presented one at a time.
Each question has four options that the user can choose from.
The current question must be answered before the next question can be attempted. Once all questions have been answered, the user is shown their results/score. Users can freely navigate to any questions that they have already answered.
Bonus points:
Demonstrate the use of a routing library in some capacity (we use React Router). Use an API to fetch the quiz data and results.
Keep track of the state using a state-management library (we use Redux Toolkit).
Mega ultra bonus points
Implement authentication to ensure that only logged-in users can interact with the quiz.
